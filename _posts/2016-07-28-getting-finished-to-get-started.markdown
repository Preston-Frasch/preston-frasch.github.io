Although I have not been officially diagnosed by a professional author, I strongly suspect that I have a bad case of finishitis.  I have heard that it is a fairly common disease, especially among creative types.  It is characterized by starting projects and...not....quite.....being.......able........to.....well, you get the idea.  If you are reading this right now, that means that I have taken a next step in my goal to self-publish a childrenâ€™s book.  You have officially been drafted into my accountability/treatment team, and I am so glad you are here.  I hope perhaps if you have your own case of finishitis, it might inspire you too.

Four years ago, I wrote a short song called Love Comes Down.  One of my dearest friends, Avery Mefford, spent hours and hours illustrating vibrant scenes and characters, bringing the words to life.  Between getting married, adopting a daughter, and the many things life brings, we have been slowly, slowly plugging away at the next step which is getting published.  There are a surprisingly number of steps and discouragement seems to lurk around each corner.  That being said, in embarking on this project, a great number of gifts have already been given.  The cure for finishitis, I suspect will in the end be gratitude--gratitude to Avery, the many people who are helping this project, and, of course, to God who delights in using small things and weak people to show His faithfulness and love.
