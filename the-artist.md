Avery Mefford is an [artist](http://www.paintedwine.com) and pianist-in-training.  Her vocational passion is working with the elderly, specifically those with dementia, but her work has taken her from the streets of Chicago to retreat centers in Virginia and many places in between.  Many moons ago, she attended Wheaton College and received her degree in Psychology and English Literature.  Her newly married husband wooed her by reading children’s books to her in coffee shops.  It worked!  Jesus is her best friend, her Lord and her God, and she has recently found a spiritual home in the Orthodox Church.  Currently, she is planting her first garden at her new house in Norwood, Ohio, reminding herself of the preciousness of all God’s creatures as the squirrels steal her beans.
