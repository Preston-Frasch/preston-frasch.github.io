Avery Mefford has always had a passion for painting, pottery, and exploring the world through art. As a child of two artists living in upstate New York, Avery visited local art shows and held her own front yard art sales often. As a youth, a number of prestigious awards were given to her work including the National Scholastic Gold Key Award. Upon entering college, she had opportunities to explore and serving in multiple Asian countries. This stirred her to pursue a degree in Education with a minor in Asian culture and arts. Cultural experience along with her relationship with the Lord have greatly impacted the formation of her pieces. Since 2007, Avery has designed hundreds of acrylic painted pieces on wine bottles under the name [Painted Wine](http://www.paintedwine.com). Avery still enjoys visiting art shows, teaching art classes, and doodling in notebooks. This passion for painting grows more complex over the years while remaining dedicatedly humble.
